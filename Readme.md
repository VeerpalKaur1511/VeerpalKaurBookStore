The current MVC application uses Entity Framework Core to enable smooth CRUD operations and has a strong design pattern that adheres to the MVC architecture. The application's ultimate purpose is to make it easier for businesses and individual users to order large quantities of books at significant rates. The application also incorporates social network login options through Google or Facebook accounts, emphasizing user ease. The user has indicated plans to add further features in the future, demonstrating a thorough and user-centered approach to the development process.
